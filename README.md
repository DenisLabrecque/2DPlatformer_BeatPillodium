# 2DPlatformer_BeatPillodium
2D Unity game made for Pensacola Christian College
This project was created for CS 335 Computer Graphics for Pensacola Christian College as the last project. It was assigned with a teammate (James Limantara). The assignment was a 2D platformer with a player, two enemies, and a boss. The enemies had to come in three waves, and the boss had to attack the player randomly.
In our assignment, I created the garbage can enemy (Krubbish), and the boss (Pillodium).
